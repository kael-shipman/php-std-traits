PHP Standard Traits
=========================================================

This package provides some basic traits that help to implement PHP interfaces like ArrayAccess, Iterator, and Countable.

It also provides an Observable Trait that implements an event system, as well as an Event object and interface and some special exceptions for use among the traits.

These are small enough that you should be able to read through them to get a good idea of how to use them. More documentation still to come....
